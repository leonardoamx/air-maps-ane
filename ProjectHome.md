**AIR Maps Native Extension**

This project provides the support for using the native mapping component in your Adobe AIR application. It uses Native Extensions to access the maps APIs for that platform and provides Action Script Interface so that it can be used in Flash Mobile applications developed using Adobe AIR.

Please see http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/articles/extending-air.html to know more about native extensions.

Note : Currently it supports only iOS native maps
